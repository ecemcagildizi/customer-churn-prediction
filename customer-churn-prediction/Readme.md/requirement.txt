# Customer Churn Prediction using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict customer churn using machine learning techniques and to identify the key factors that influence customer retention. 
The goal is not only to build a predictive model, but also to extract meaningful business insights that can help reduce customer churn.



## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Customer Churn dataset, which contains 7,043 customer records with demographic, service usage, and contract information.

- Target Variable : Churn (Yes/No)
- Numerical Features : tenure, MonthlyCharges, TotalCharges
- Categorical Features : contract type, internet service, payment method



## Methodology 

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data cleaning and handling missing values
- Feature engineering and one-hot encoding
- Feature scaling using StandardScaler
- Model training using Logistic Regression
- Model evaluation using Accuracy, Classification Report, and ROC-AUC



## Model Performance
- Accuracy : ~80%
- ROC - AUC : 0.836

The ROC - AUC score indicates strong discriminatory power, especially important for imbalanced datasets like customer churn.




## Key Insights 
- Long-term contracts (1 year and 2 year) significantly reduce churn risk 
- Customer tenure is one of the strongest indicators of retention
- Fiber optic internet service is associated with higher churn, possibly due to pricing or service expectations 



## Technologies Used 
- Python
- Pandas & NumPy 
- Scikit - Learn
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
